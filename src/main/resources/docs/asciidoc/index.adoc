= SpaceUp Server
thraax.session@iatlas.technology

SpaceUp is a "simple" server / client construct, which helps provide or do actions on your webhost. Or just simplify things without using ssh/console.
It does as much possible without even a database (only saving credentials / install process), to keep it easy as possible.

== Features

* Adding/Deleting domains
* Start/Stop/Restart services
* Inspecting logfiles of the corresponding service
* Have a look on the space
* Future feature: You can write your own (automation) script (*.sus) to even more simplify jobs and stuff.
Like updating a piece of software. And this script will be automatically available as REST service and visible in the app! Cool, right? üòÅ

== Build & Run

Explain what it requires and how to build the project.
This project requires Java 8 (min) and you can build it executing the following command:

[source,console]
----
./gradlew build
java -jar SpaceUp-{Version}-all.jar
***REMOVED*** Don't forget to create web backend to make it publish
----

After the first run, you have run the installation procedure which is also explained in the swagger-ui. (Only in dev mode)

See:

* https://<yourserver>:9090/redoc
* https://<yourserver>:9090/rapidoc

== Architecture

The SpaceUp Server can run locally or directly on Uberspace and will open SSH channel to Uberspace.
