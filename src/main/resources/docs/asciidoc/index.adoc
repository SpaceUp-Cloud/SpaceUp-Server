= SpaceUp Server
thraax.session@iatlas.technology

SpaceUp is a "simple" server / client construct, which helps provide or do actions on your webhost. Or just simplify things without using ssh/console.
It does as much possible without a database (only saving credentials / install process), to keep it easy as possible.

The server application is written in kotlin with micronaut as web framework. The client is written in Dart with Flutter as framework.

== Features

* Adding/Deleting domains
* Start/Stop/Restart services
* Inspecting logfiles of the corresponding service
* Have a look on the space
* Future feature: You can write your own (automation) script (*.sus) to even more simplify jobs and stuff.
Like updating a piece of software. And this script will be automatically available as REST service and visible in the app! Cool, right? üòÅ

* Other features which are planned:
** Handle web backends (uberspace web commands)
** Handle mail (uberspace mail commands)
** Add/Delete services with internal editor
** Like written above: SUS-Scripts (SpaceUp Script) to create simple automation
** Support GraalVM as native application for smaller footprint
** Migrating to JVM 11 =< x
** ... and so on.

If any other feature is wished, write me a small email, so I will register you for youtrack to open an issue:
*thraax.session@iatlas.technology*

Little big bonus: There is a multiplatform app (written in Flutter) which already consumes the APIs. üòÅ
You should know it's not tested with ios/osx as I am not an apple user.
But it works for Web, Android, Windows and soon Linux.

== Code Repo / Bug tracker / etc.

I've of course my own tool infrastructure where I keep my code and bugs in place.

Git: https://git.iatlas.dev/SpaceUp

Youtrack: https://yt.iatlas.dev/articles/SU-A-1/Preamble

Artifactory: https://artifactory.iatlas.dev/***REMOVED***browse/browse:technology.iatlas.spaceup:technology%2Fiatlas%2Fspaceup%2FSpaceUp

Youtrack is mainly for bug tracking but also a little knowledgebase.
But the main documentation will be in Asciidoc which will be updated with the server application.

It can be visited here: https://<yourserver>:9090


== Build & Run

=== Server application

Requirements:

* Java 8

The application itself is a fatjar which can be directly executed.

[source,console]
----
./gradlew build

***REMOVED***
***REMOVED*** The parameters are necessary for now.
***REMOVED*** Later they will be used from the installation process.
***REMOVED***

java -jar SpaceUp-{Version}-all.jar -micronaut.host.server=0.0.0.0 -spaceup.ssh.host=<Your server to connect> -spaceup.ssh.username=<User> -spaceup.ssh.password=<Password>
----

Don't forget to create the uberspace web backend to make it external visible for the client. üòâ

After the first run, you have run the installation procedure which is also explained in the swagger-ui. (Only in dev mode)

See:

* https://<yourserver>:9090/swagger-ui
* https://<yourserver>:9090/redoc
* https://<yourserver>:9090/rapidoc

=== Client application

I'll upload regular the client apps here:
https://artifactory.iatlas.dev/***REMOVED***browse/browse:spaceup-client

Requirements:

* Flutter (current version)
* ADB (if you want to install it directly on your Android phone)

[source,console]
----
***REMOVED*** platform: apk, web, windows and etc.
flutter build <platform> --no-sound-null-safety
----

Afterwards you can find it here:
----
<your-directory>\SpaceUp-UI\spaceup_ui\build\windows\runner\Release
----

== Architecture

The SpaceUp Server can run locally or directly on Uberspace and will open SSH channel to Uberspace.

[plantuml, architecture-diagram, svg, opts=inline]
----
!pragma layout smetana
package "Client side" {
    [SpaceUp Client] <-> HTTP
}

package "Local or Uberspace Server" {
    SSH <-left-> [SpaceUp Server] : Remote scripts
    HTTP <-left-> [SpaceUp Server]
}

cloud {
    SSH <-right-> [Uberspace] : ""
