== Description

SpaceUp is a "simple" server / client construct, which helps provide or do actions on your webhost. Or just simplify things without using ssh/console.
It does as much possible without a database (only saving credentials / install process), to keep it easy as possible.

The server application is written in kotlin with micronaut as web framework. The client is written in Dart with Flutter as framework.

== Features

* Adding/Deleting domains
* Start/Stop/Restart services
* Inspecting logfiles of the corresponding service
* Have a look on the space

* Other features which are planned:
** Handle web backends (uberspace web commands)
** Handle mail (uberspace mail commands)
** Add/Delete services with internal editor
** Support GraalVM as native application for smaller footprint
** Migrating to JVM 11 =< x
** Self-Updating JAR (Never download it by yourself again!)
** Write your own (automation) script (*.sus) to even more simplify jobs and stuff.
Like updating a piece of software. And this script will be automatically available as REST service and visible in the app! Cool, right? 😁
** ... and so on.

If any other feature is wished, write me a small email, so I will register you for youtrack to open an issue:
*thraax.session@iatlas.technology*

Little big bonus: There is a multiplatform app (written in Flutter) which already consumes the APIs. 😁
You should know it's not tested with ios/osx as I am not an apple user.
But it works for Web, Android, Windows and soon Linux.

== Code Repo / Bug tracker / etc.

I've of course my own tool infrastructure where I keep my code and bugs in place.

Git: https://git.iatlas.dev/SpaceUp

Youtrack: https://yt.iatlas.dev/articles/SU-A-1/Preamble

Artifactory:
https://artifactory.iatlas.dev/#browse/browse:technology.iatlas.spaceup:technology%2Fiatlas%2Fspaceup%2FSpaceUp

Youtrack is mainly for bug tracking but also a little knowledgebase.
But the main documentation will be here in Asciidoc which will be regularly updated.

== Build & Run

=== Server application

Requirements:

* Java 8

The application itself is a fatjar which can be directly executed.

[console]
----
# Build the jar file
./gradlew assemble

#
# The parameters are necessary for now.
# Later they will be used from the installation process.
#

# Normal prod usecase
java -jar target/lib/SpaceUp-{Version}-all.jar -micronaut.server.host=0.0.0.0 -micronaut.host.port=<Your Port>

# In dev you can directly supply SSH configuration when you pass "-spaceup.dev.ssh.db-credentials=true"
# Default is '-spaceup.dev.ssh.db-credentials=false'
# If you've got troubles, increase loglevel with '-spaceup.logging.level=DEBUG'
java -jar target/lib/SpaceUp-{Version}-all.jar -micronaut.server.host=127.0.0.1 -micronaut.host.port=<Your Port> -spaceup.ssh.host=<Your server to connect> -spaceup.ssh.username=<User> -spaceup.ssh.password=<Password>
----

Don't forget to create the uberspace web backend to make it external visible for the client. 😉

*After the first run, you have run the installation procedure* which is also explained in the swagger-ui.
Swaager-ui, redoc and rapidoc are only available in dev mode as they are normally not necessary to finish the installation.
In the near time I will adapt the app which helps you to finish the set up SpaceUp.

See:

* {data-baseurl}/swagger-ui
* {data-baseurl}/redoc
* {data-baseurl}/rapidoc

After first startup you will be greeted with this console output.
*Beware the output of they API Key, which you need to verify that it is you, when you finish the installation!*

=== Client application

I'll upload regular the client apps here:
https://artifactory.iatlas.dev/#browse/browse:spaceup-client

But if you like to build it by your own, go ahead with the following!

Requirements:

* Flutter (current version)
* ADB (if you want to install it directly on your Android phone)

[console]
----
# platform: apk, web, windows and etc.
flutter build <platform> --no-sound-null-safety
----

Afterwards you can find it here:
----
<your-directory>\SpaceUp-UI\spaceup_ui\build\windows\runner\Release
----

== Architecture

The SpaceUp Server can run locally or directly on Uberspace and will open SSH channel to Uberspace / to local SSHD.

=== The Big Picture

    [SpaceUp Client] <-> HTTP : "CRUD"

package "Local or Uberspace Server" {
